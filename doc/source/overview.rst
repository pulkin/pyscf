An overview of PySCF
********************

PySCF is an ab initio computational chemistry program implemented in
Python program language.  The package aims to provide a simple,
light-weight and efficient platform for electronic structure theory
developing and simulation.   The package offers a wide range of
functions to support the electronic structure mean-field and
post-mean-field calculations of finite size systems and periodic systems.
Users can run simulations with input script as the regular quantum
chemistry package offers, or investigate new features by combining
primitive functions, or modifying source code to
rapidly achieve certain requirements as they want.  Although most
functions are written in Python, the computation critical modules are
intensively optimized in C.  The package works as efficient as other
C/Fortran based quantum chemistry program.
