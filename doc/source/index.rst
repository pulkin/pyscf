Welcome to PySCF documentation!
===============================

PySCF is a collection of electronic structure programs powered by Python.
The package aims to provide a simple, light-weight and efficient platform for
quantum chemistry code developing and calculation.  The program is developed in
the principle of

* Easy to install, to use, to extend and to be embedded;

* Minimal requirements on libraries (No Boost, MPI) and computing
  resources (perhaps losing efficiency to reduce I/O);

* 90/10 Python/C, only computational hot spots were written in C;

* 90/10 functional/OOP, unless performance critical, functions are pure.
