"""
This and other `_slow` modules implement the time-dependent Hartree-Fock procedure. The primary performance drawback is
that, unlike other 'fast' routines with an implicit construction of the eigenvalue problem, these modules construct
TDHF matrices explicitly via an AO-MO transformation, i.e. with a O(N^5) complexity scaling. As a result, regular
`numpy.linalg.eig` can be used to retrieve TDHF roots in a reliable fashion without any issues related to the Davidson
procedure. Several variants of TDHF are available:

 * `pyscf.tdscf.rhf_slow`: the molecular implementation;
 * `pyscf.pbc.tdscf.rhf_slow`: PBC (periodic boundary condition) implementation for RHF objects of `pyscf.pbc.scf`
   modules;
 * `pyscf.pbc.tdscf.krhf_slow_supercell`: PBC implementation for KRHF objects of `pyscf.pbc.scf` modules. Works with
   an arbitrary number of k-points but has a overhead due to an effective construction of a supercell;
 * (this module) `pyscf.pbc.tdscf.krhf_slow_gamma`: A Gamma-point calculation resembling the original `pyscf.pbc.tdscf.krhf`
   module. Despite its name, it accepts KRHF objects with an arbitrary number of k-points but finds only few TDHF roots
   corresponding to collective oscillations without momentum transfer;
 * `pyscf.pbc.tdscf.krhf_slow`: PBC implementation for KRHF objects of `pyscf.pbc.scf` modules. Works with
   an arbitrary number of k-points and employs k-point conservation (diagonalizes matrix blocks separately).
